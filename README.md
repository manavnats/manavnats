## About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at Waseda University with a focus on **artificial intelligence and natural language processing** as tools for building meaningful things.

Outside of the core engineering track, I explore how intelligent systems intersect with fields like **finance and sports**, two domains where data is rich, and the right insight at the right moment is everything.

## What I'm Working On

- 🧠 **AI & NLP Applications** — Researching and prototyping systems that process, understand, and generate language in meaningful ways. From information extraction to intelligent assistants, I'm interested in the full stack of making language models useful.
- 📈 **Finance + Tech** — Exploring how ML and NLP techniques can surface signal in financial data — earnings calls, market sentiment, SEC filings, and beyond.
- 🏟️ **Sports Analytics** — Building at the intersection of performance data and machine intelligence. Sports generate enormous amounts of structured and unstructured data; I love finding what's hidden in it.
- 🛠️ **Turning Ideas Into Products** — I'm not just interested in what's technically possible. I want to build things that are thoughtfully designed, easy to use, and actually deployed.
