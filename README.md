## About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student with a focus on **artificial intelligence and natural language processing** as tools for building meaningful things.

Outside of the core engineering track, I explore how intelligent systems intersect with fields like **finance and sports**, two domains where data is rich, and the right insight at the right moment is everything.

## What I'm Working On

-  **AI & NLP Applications** — Researching and prototyping systems that process, understand, and generate language in meaningful ways. From information extraction to intelligent assistants, I'm interested in the full stack of making language models useful.
-  **Finance + Tech** — Exploring how ML and NLP techniques can surface signal in financial data — market sentiment, stock behaviour prediction, and beyond.

I want to build things that are thoughtfully designed, easy to use, and actually deployed.
