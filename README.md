## About Me

I'm a Computer Engineering student at [Your University] with a focus on **artificial intelligence and natural language processing** — not as buzzwords, but as tools for building things that actually matter.

My work lives at the edge of research and product. I care about understanding *why* a model behaves the way it does just as much as I care about shipping something people can use. I'm drawn to the messy, interesting middle ground between a good idea and a working system.

Outside of the core engineering track, I explore how intelligent systems intersect with fields like **finance and sports** — two domains where decisions are high-stakes, data is rich, and the right insight at the right moment is everything.

## What I'm Working On

- 🧠 **AI & NLP Applications** — Researching and prototyping systems that process, understand, and generate language in meaningful ways. From information extraction to intelligent assistants, I'm interested in the full stack of making language models useful.
- 📈 **Finance + Tech** — Exploring how ML and NLP techniques can surface signal in financial data — earnings calls, market sentiment, SEC filings, and beyond.
- 🏟️ **Sports Analytics** — Building at the intersection of performance data and machine intelligence. Sports generate enormous amounts of structured and unstructured data; I love finding what's hidden in it.
- 🛠️ **Turning Ideas Into Products** — I'm not just interested in what's technically possible. I want to build things that are thoughtfully designed, easy to use, and actually deployed.

## How I Think About Building

Good engineering, to me, means three things working together:

**Curiosity** — I read papers, break things, and ask a lot of questions. I'd rather understand something deeply than copy a solution I don't fully grasp.

**Execution** — Ideas are cheap. I try to move from concept to prototype quickly, learn from what doesn't work, and iterate toward something real.

**Context** — Technology doesn't exist in a vacuum. The best products come from understanding the domain they serve — whether that's how a trader thinks about risk or how a coach evaluates player performance.

## Let's Connect

I'm always open to conversations about AI research, interesting product ideas, or collaborations that sit at the edge of something unfamiliar. If you're building something in the AI, finance, or sports space — or just want to talk through an idea — reach out.
